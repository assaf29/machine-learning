In this project i have used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, 
then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
The files available for the project are:
Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Data_Dictionary.md: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.
Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for completing the project. The notebook provides more details and tips than the outline given here.
